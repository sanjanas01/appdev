Android App Development Repository
Welcome to my Android app development repository! This project encompasses a variety of Android development concepts and features, showcasing practical implementations and exercises.

Key Features
User Interface (UI):

Designed login screens and other UI components using XML layouts.
Customized colors and dimensions externally managed in colors.xml and dimens.xml.
Activities and Intents:

Implemented multiple activities and used intents for navigation and data passing between activities.
Resource Management:

Externalized resources like strings and colors for easier localization and maintenance.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Kotlin:

Demonstrated OOP principles and designed UML diagrams for class relationships.
Functions, Lambdas, and Higher-Order Functions:

Used Kotlin’s functional features for concise and expressive code.
Implicit and Explicit Intents:

Utilized both types of intents for navigating within the app and launching external actions.
Activity Lifecycle:

Managed activity lifecycle events and wrote logs for debugging purposes.
Unit Testing with JUnit:

Implemented unit tests to validate functionality and ensure robust code.
Extension Functions and Properties in Kotlin:

Extended functionality of existing classes using Kotlin’s extension capabilities.
RecyclerView and Adapter Design Pattern:

Implemented RecyclerView for efficient data presentation and used the Adapter pattern.
Concurrency with Coroutines:

Used Kotlin coroutines for managing asynchronous tasks and improving app performance.
UI Testing with Espresso:

Automated UI tests to verify app behavior using Espresso framework.
Web Services Integration with Retrofit:

Connected the app to web services, parsed JSON responses, and displayed data dynamically.
Image Handling:

Loaded images from URLs and displayed them in RecyclerView or other UI components.
Other Concepts:
Room Database
Notifications
Getting Location using GPS
Google Maps Integration



Branches
This repository contains two main branches:

Concepts: This branch includes implementations and exercises based on concepts learned in class. It serves as a showcase of fundamental Android development skills and practices.

Codelab: The codelab branch contains specific exercises and projects completed during hands-on sessions or guided tutorials. It focuses on practical application of learned concepts in structured exercises.
