# Android App Development Repository

Welcome to my Android app development repository! This project encompasses a variety of Android development concepts and features, showcasing practical implementations and exercises.

## Key Features

### User Interface (UI)
- Designed login screens and other UI components using XML layouts.
- Customized colors and dimensions managed in `colors.xml` and `dimens.xml`.

### Activities and Intents
- Implemented multiple activities and used intents for navigation and data passing.

### Resource Management
- Externalized resources like strings and colors for easier localization and maintenance.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Kotlin
- Demonstrated OOP principles and designed UML diagrams for class relationships.

### Functions, Lambdas, and Higher-Order Functions
- Used Kotlin’s functional features for concise and expressive code.

### Implicit and Explicit Intents
- Utilized intents for navigating within the app and launching external actions.

### Activity Lifecycle
- Managed activity lifecycle events and utilized logging for debugging.

### Unit Testing with JUnit
- Implemented unit tests to validate functionality and ensure robust code.

### Extension Functions and Properties in Kotlin
- Extended functionality of existing classes using Kotlin’s extension capabilities.

### RecyclerView and Adapter Design Pattern
